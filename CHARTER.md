# Graphics Charter

The Graphics Special Interest Group (SIG) is concerned with aligning the RISC-V ecosystem with the needs of modern graphics accelerators capable of programmable shaders. The Graphics SIG ensures the alignment with the programmable shading standards by:

* contributing to existing RISC-V extensions functionality identified as strategic for efficient implementation of graphics-specific operations

* representing the graphics domain towards the groups operating under the RISC-V umbrella

* driving the creation of task-groups for new ISA extensions when no pre-existing ones match the domain needs

* driving the creation of software-centric domain-specific task-groups

* providing direction for extending the existing software tools such as compilers, simulators and conformance test suites.

The constituency represented by the Graphics SIG are implementers of programmable graphics solutions based on the RISC-V instruction set. By using an open ISA, these implementers leverage on a set of open source software tools maintained by the members of the RISC-V Foundation.
