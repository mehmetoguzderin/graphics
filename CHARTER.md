# Graphics Charter

The Graphics Special Interest Group (SIG) will develop the strategy, do gap analysis and prioritization of those gaps to enable RSC-V implementers of hardware and  software to enable modern graphics accelerators. The aforementioned strategy encompasses:

- working with and contributing to existing Committees, SIGs, and TGs developing RISC-V extensions and software ecosystem components identified as strategic for efficient implementation of graphics-specific operations

- representation of RISC-V towards external organizations also operating within the graphics domain

- creation of task-groups or enabling efforts for new ISA extensions or software ecosystem components or specifications where no pre-existing ones match the domain needs

The constituency represented by the RISC-V Graphics SIG are organizations or individuals interested in modern graphics accelerators using RISC-V to any degree. By using an open ISA, the members leverage on a set of software tools maintained by the RISC-V ecosystem
