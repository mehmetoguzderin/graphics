# Graphics Charter

The Graphics Special Interest Group (SIG) is concerned with aligning the RISC-V ecosystem with the needs of modern graphics accelerators. The Graphics SIG ensures the alignment with the needs of modern graphics accelerators by defining and implementing a strategy for RISC-V International to operate within the graphics domain. The aforementioned strategy encompasses:

- contributions to existing RISC-V extensions of functionality identified as strategic for efficient implementation of graphics-specific operations

- representation of the graphics domain towards the groups operating under the RISC-V umbrella

- representation of RISC-V towards external organizations also operating within the graphics domain

- creation of task-groups for new ISA extensions when no pre-existing ones match the domain needs

- direction for extending software tools such as compilers, simulators and conformance test suites.

The constituency represented by the RISC-V Graphics SIG are organizations or individuals interested in modern graphics accelerators using RISC-V to any degree. By using an open ISA, the members leverage on a set of software tools maintained by the RISC-V ecosystem.
