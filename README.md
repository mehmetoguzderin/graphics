# Graphics and Machine Learning Special Interest Group

The Graphics and Machine Learning Special Interest Group (SIG) develops the strategy,
does gap analysis and prioritizes tasks for enabling RISC-V implementers to support
modern graphics and machine learning accelerators.

The group is the result of having recently (December 2021) fused the Graphics and
Machine Learing efforts for synergically developing our common agenda items.

Our approved [charter](https://github.com/riscv-admin/graphics/blob/main/CHARTER.md)
gives a more precise definition of our purpose within RISC-V.

# Meeting minutes

The minutes and other materials we use during our meetings are collected in this repo,
under the [minutes](https://github.com/riscv-admin/graphics/tree/main/minutes) folder.

# Other resources
Some of the initial work from this group is briefed on this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM0lsWjqOaw).

# Collaboration

We are a mixture of volunteers and member companies trying to bring RISC-V to new domains.
The group welcomes collaboration, with the solely condition that you join the RISC-V Foundation
under the (really reasonable) terms and conditions in the [membership](https://riscv.org/membership/)
section from the RISC-V Foundation website.

If you have any doubts you can email the group organizers for
additional information:
- Abel Bernabeu <<abel.bernabeu@esperantotech.com>>, Chair
- Atif Zafar, Vice-chair
